#What I did well, process wise:
-creating the react app, initializing and adding it as a remote to github
-pushing it to github, running the app to the development server
-as for feature 1, created 4 pages, set the correct route path, created a navbar to navigate between pages, created 2 buttons at the homepage and linked them to the correct pages, created a navlink component to indicate at what page the user is.
-as for feature 2, created a new component and hardcoded it first to show the appointment details to both homepage and "who is on duty" page, then created another component to make the opening hour dynamic, and linked this new component to the previous component.
-as for feature 3, to display doctor availability, I fetched the data from the provided api using useState/useEffect hook, displayed the data using .map, and used html table elements to display the data in order. Whilw thw data is being fetched, a loading message will be displayed.
-as for feature 4, first I hardcoded a form with necessary info using html, and created a button of the type button to prevent the page from refreshing on submission. here I used a dropdown for gender and a datepicker for date of birth. Then used useState hook to control the state of the form, console logged every input data, and showed a confirmation message on submission
-as for feature 5,first created a props to pass through a component for showing patient id, name, date of birth and a view details button. then in the component, fetched the patient data using the api, and sorted the patient list by their last name. at this point I got stuck and lost.

#What I would do differently next time to improve, process wise
-this time, I followed the go with the flow method, next time I will finish the easy parts first to earn more points and boost up my confidence. I need to speed up, I don't know how I can achieve that.
